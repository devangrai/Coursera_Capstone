Our business problem is simple: **how do we provide support for tourists who flock to New York to help them visualize different districts and neighborhoods to scout out culinary and food venues that satisfy their needs?**\n\n\nWith nearly 65.2 million tourists annually, New York is expected to see a greater number of tourists due to the current quarantine conditions. \n\nNew York is one of many culinary capitals of the world, branding its own takes on popular foods, such as New York cheesecake and New York pizza. However, it is not easy for tourists to locate ideal restaurants. A quick Google search will show many varying reviews for a variety of different locations. This makes it hard for tourists to identify neighborhoods with the best restaurants and cuisine.\n\nIn this project, we will be utilizing Foursquare and machine learning to group different neighborhoods by their restauarant venues information."
